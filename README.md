# Sahar Esmaeeli, PhD
**Genomics | Precision Medicine | Translational Bioinformatics**

I lead genetics and bioinformatics programs that connect GWAS, multi‑omics, and clinical data to decisions in patient stratification, trial enrichment, and biomarker strategy. I have 15+ years across biotech and pharma, with hands‑on delivery and cross‑functional leadership.

## Highlights
- Built a PRS based enrollment enrichment approach that reduced screening failures and cut planned Phase 2 timelines by about 50 percent
- Co led an NGS companion diagnostic with QIAGEN through CLIA CAP handoff
- Led multi‑omics evidence pipelines and knowledge graph work to accelerate target and biomarker decisions
- Delivered production ML and analytics with engineering, including testing, versioning, and monitoring

## Focus areas
- GWAS QC and locus visualization
- QTL colocalization across eQTL, pQTL, and sQTL
- Clinical and RWE data integration
- Reproducible pipelines and clear reporting
