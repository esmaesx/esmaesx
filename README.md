Three repositories that represent my current focus in statistical genetics and precision medicine:

1. **[patient-trial-enrichment](https://github.com/esmaesx/patient-trial-enrichment)** — Pipeline for stratifying patients and enriching clinical trials using polygenic risk scores. Used to cut enrollment timelines by ~50% in Phase 2 programs.

2. **[coloc-qtl-pipeline](https://github.com/esmaesx/coloc-qtl-pipeline)** — Statistical genetics workflow for colocalizing QTLs with GWAS hits. Core method for prioritizing causal variants and interpreting functional consequences.

3. **[gwas-functional-annotation](https://github.com/esmaesx/gwas-functional-annotation)** — Locus visualization and functional annotation for interpreting GWAS associations in therapeutic context.

# Sahar Esmaeeli, PhD

**Genomics | Precision Medicine | Translational Bioinformatics**

I lead genetics and bioinformatics programs that connect GWAS, multi‑omics, and clinical data to decisions in patient stratification, trial enrichment, and biomarker strategy. I have 15+ years across biotech and pharma, with hands‑on delivery and cross‑functional leadership.

## Highlights

- Built a PRS based enrollment enrichment approach that reduced screening failures and cut planned Phase 2 timelines by about 50 percent
- Co led an NGS companion diagnostic with QIAGEN through CLIA CAP handoff
- Led multi‑omics evidence pipelines and knowledge graph work to accelerate target and biomarker decisions
- Delivered production ML and analytics with engineering, including testing, versioning, and monitoring

## Focus areas

- Translational genetics strategy and study design
- Patient stratification, trial enrichment, and biomarker development
- Biobank scale analytics, GWAS, PRS, and colocalization
- Multi‑omics and clinical integration with decision‑grade reporting
- Production ML and analytics with engineering standards

## Tech

- Python, R, bash
- GWAS and QTL data wrangling and colocalization
- Reproducible analysis structure using notebooks, src, and reports
